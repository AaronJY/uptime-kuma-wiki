In order to to expose uptime-kuma to the web securely, it is recommended to proxy it behind a traditional webserver such as nginx or Apache. Below are some example configurations that you could use.

### Nginx

With SSL:
```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name sub.domain.com;
  ssl_certificate     /path/to/ssl/cert/crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/ssl/key/key;

  location / {
    proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_pass         http://localhost:3001/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header   Connection "upgrade";
  }
}
```

Without SSL:
```nginx
server  {
    listen 80;
    server_name    sub.domain.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
    }
}
```

### Apache
With SSL:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName sub.domain.com
  SSLEngine On
  SSLCertificateFile /path/to/ssl/cert/crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/ssl/key/key
  # Protocol 'h2' is only supported on Apache 2.4.17 or newer.
  Protocols h2 http/1.1

  ProxyPass / http://localhost:3001/
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
  RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://localhost:3001/$1" [P,L]
</VirtualHost>
```

Without SSL:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName sub.domain.com

  ProxyPass / http://localhost:3001/
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
  RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://localhost:3001/$1" [P,L]
</VirtualHost>
```

### Caddy

```nginx
subdomain.domain.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3001 :
}
```

### SSL/HTTPS

It is recommended to use SSL(HTTPS) with your web-server to avoid MiTM attacks when on a public network. If using caddy these certificates will be auto-generated by caddy and will keep them updated.

If your using Apache or NGINX, it is recommended to use CertBot to manage SSL for free, it uses Let's Encrypt to get it's certificates and keeps them renewed. You can also use your own Certificates and place them as shown above. If using cerbot use the "Without SSL" settings and then run certbot on it and it will automatically configure auto-HTTPS redirection.
